This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict student's academic success.

## ðŸ“š About

The Student Success Predictor project addresses the critical issue of academic dropout and failure in higher education. The dataset was meticulously created with the primary goal of leveraging machine learning techniques to identify students at risk early in their academic journey. The ultimate aim is to implement targeted strategies and support systems that contribute to the reduction of academic dropout. Throughout the project, we built machine learning models, like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression (with L1 and L2 regularization), to predict if a student might drop out.

Due to a large number of features and their inter-correlations, our initial models exhibited signs of overfitting. We therefore incorporated feature selection techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and feature importance analysis, coupled with fine-tuning the models' parameters. The refined models demonstrated enhanced performance, evident in a minimized gap between training and validation accuracy. Among the three models, SVM marginally outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 80% and an AUC score of 0.89. However, there remains potential for further improvement in model performance through additional feature engineering and more comprehensive parameter tuning.

Our dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success).

## Analysis

In the src directory, you will find four Jupyter notebooks: data_analysis_final_report.ipynb, data_analysis_model.ipynb, data_analysis_EDA.ipynb, and data_analysis_parameter_optimization.ipynb. For a comprehensive view of the analysis, execute data_analysis_final_report.ipynb, which integrates all individual parts. If you're interested in the specifics of each analytical segment, the other notebooks can be run separately to explore each in more detail.

## ðŸ“„ Report

We have compiled our analysis into a comprehensive report, which can be accessed [through this link](https://ubc-mds.github.io/Student_Success_Predict_Group15/src/data_analysis_final_report.html). Our report includes several charts and visualizations that effectively aid in understanding the data patterns and analytical results. We welcome any feedback and suggestions you may have.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Docker is a container solution used to manage the software dependencies for this project. The Docker image used for this project is based on the quay.io/jupyter/minimal-notebook:2023-11-19 image. Additioanal dependencies are specified int the Dockerfile.

## ðŸ’» Usage Via Docker

Setup
1. Install and launch Docker on your computer.
2. Clone this GitHub repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:UBC-MDS/Student_Success_Predict_Group15.git
```

Running the analysis
1. Navigate to the root of this project on your computer using the command line and run
   ```
   docker compose up
   ```
2. In the terminal, look for a URL that starts with http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=. Copy and paste that URL into your browser to run jupyter lab.
3. To run the analysis, enter the following commands in the terminal at the scripts folder:
```
#download and extract data
python download_data.py --url https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success.zip --write-to ../data/raw/

# split data into train and test sets, preprocess data for eda 
# and save preprocessor
python split_n_preprocess.py --raw-data ../data/raw/data.csv --data-to ../data/processed/ --preprocessor-to ../results/models/ --drop_column ../data/processed/drop_column.csv --numeric_column ../data/processed/numeric_column.csv --categorical-column ../data/processed/categorical_column.csv --ordinal-column ../data/processed/ordinal_column.csv --binary-column ../data/processed/binary_column.csv

#perform eda and save plots
python eda.py --training-data ../data/processed/student_train.csv --plot-to ../results/figures/

#train and fit the model, as well as saving the models
python fit_student_classifier.py --original-train ../data/processed/student_train.csv --preprocessor ../results/models/student_preprocessor.pickle --pipeline-to ../results/models/ --result-to ../results/tables/

# evaluate model on test data and save results
python evaluate_student_predictor.py --original-test ../data/processed/student_test.csv --scaled-test-data ../data/processed/scaled_student_test.csv --rf-from ../results/models/RF_model.pickle --lr-from ../results/models/LR_model.pickle --svc-from ../results/models/SVC_model.pickle --results-to ../results/tables/


```
4. To build a HTML report, type the following command on the project root:
```
jupyter-book build report
```

Clean up
1. Type Contrl + C in the terminal where you launched the container to shut down the container and clean up the resources
2. run
```
docker compose rm
```

### Developer notes

To add a new dependency, follow the steps below:

1. Add the dependency to the Dockerfile file on a new branch.
2. Re-build the Docker image locally to ensure it builds and runs properly.
3. Push the changes to GitHub. A new Docker image will be built and pushed to Docker Hub automatically. The tag will be the SHA for the commit that changed the file.
4. Update the docker-compose.yml fil to use the new container image .
5. Send a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch.
