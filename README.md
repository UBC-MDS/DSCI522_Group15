This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict student's academic success.

## ðŸ“š About

The Student Success Predictor project addresses the critical issue of academic dropout and failure in higher education. The dataset was meticulously created with the primary goal of leveraging machine learning techniques to identify students at risk early in their academic journey. The ultimate aim is to implement targeted strategies and support systems that contribute to the reduction of academic dropout. In this project, we attempt to build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to determine a student's academic success. Our dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success).

## ðŸ“„ Report

The final report will be available upon completion of the project.

## ðŸ’» Usage

For the first time running the project, run the following from the root of this repository:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yaml --name student_success_predictor
```

To run the analysis, activate the conda environment and start Jupyter Lab:

```         
conda activate student_success_predictor
jupyter lab 
```

Open the jupyter lab and run the [analysis file]().
